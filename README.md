# C++: Relational Database Management System (Spring 2017)

[C++ interpretation of UCB’s Spring 2017 CS 61B Project #2.](http://datastructur.es/sp17/materials/proj/proj2/proj2.html "UCB CS 61B Spring 2017 Project Requirements")

The RDMS translates user input/data entries into plain text “.txt” or “.tbl” files. The program can then store,
organize, or manipulate the user input in the form of tables. These commands emulate DML and DDL found in SQL. Each table possesses columns which define the specific qualities and relationship between rows of individual entities - effectively making the use of DDL /DML possible.
